# Async Calculator CLI

A command-line calculator application built with Dart that demonstrates the use of classes and asynchronous operations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Input validation
- Asynchronous calculation operations
- Object-oriented design with separate classes for calculator logic and input handling

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Dart SDK installed on your system
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
dart run lib/main.dart
```

## Usage

1. Enter the first number when prompted
2. Choose an operation (+, -, *, /)
3. Enter the second number
4. View the result
5. Choose whether to perform another calculation or exit

## Project Structure

- `lib/main.dart`: Contains the main application code
  - `Calculator` class: Handles arithmetic operations asynchronously
  - `InputHandler` class: Manages user input and validation
  - `main()` function: Orchestrates the application flow
